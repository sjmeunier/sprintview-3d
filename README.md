# SprintView 3D
A Unity 3D app showing stats for sprints via the VSTS API

I used this app mostly to learn a few Unity techniques such as accessing webservices via Unity and animating objects, therefore it is an arbitrary mix of actually useful information with a lot of frivolous stuff thrown in purely for the sake of it.

The app currently has 4 predefined chart types, namely:
* Burndown - Story Points
* Burndown - Items
* Burnup - Story Points
* Burnup - Items

The controls are as follows:
* Pan - Right-click while moving the mouse
* Rotate - Left-click while moving the mouse
* Zoom - Up/Down arrows
* R - Reset camera to starting position
* Esc - Open settings menu

I made use of the following free models and scripts in the project:
* [Black Dragon by 3dhaupt](https://free3d.com/3d-model/black-dragon-rigged-and-game-ready-92023.html)
* [Wispy Skybox by Mundus Limited](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/21737)
